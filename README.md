# Adaptive-Expert-System

An open-source project to develop a self-evolving AI expert system that can adapt, learn, and improve autonomously.

# Project Vision
The Adaptive Expert System is a visionary project aimed at building a self-improving AI system capable of acting as a dynamic “professor” or “adaptive agent.” This AI system will continuously update its knowledge through real-time data ingestion, active learning from user interactions, and autonomous retraining. Imagine an AI that teaches and evolves its expertise based on user queries, feedback, and external data sources—becoming a powerful resource for ongoing learning and discovery.

# Key Components
# 1. Initial Knowledge Base (Expert Model + RAG System)

  Leverages a fine-tuned language model (e.g., a customized Llama or GPT model) along with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
  Uses a vector database (like Milvus or Pinecone) to store and retrieve structured knowledge, allowing the model to answer complex questions   based on reliable sources.

# 2. Question-Driven Knowledge Expansion (Active Learning)

  During interaction sessions, the system logs questions and identifies frequent topics or knowledge gaps.
  This enables the system to focus on relevant areas for further learning, ensuring its knowledge base remains practical and user-centered.

# 3. Autonomous Data Collection and Ingestion

  An automated pipeline to gather new information from trusted sources (e.g., RSS feeds, academic sites) on identified topics.
  Data is cleaned, processed, and added to the RAG system’s database, expanding the AI’s "library" with up-to-date knowledge.

# 4. Self-Training and Assimilation

  A self-improvement cycle where the AI fine-tunes or retrains itself on newly ingested information, retaining core expertise while adding      new insights.
  Utilizes reinforcement learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (like LoRA, PEFT) to optimize computational efficiency.

# 5. Evaluation and Adjustment (Continuous Improvement)

  Regular performance assessments using test questions or simulated interactions.
  Adjusts the training process based on evaluation results, ensuring continuous learning and improvement.

# Project Goals
Develop a functional prototype of an adaptive expert system that can respond accurately to questions and learn autonomously.
Create an open-source platform where contributors can collaborate to test, refine, and expand the system’s capabilities.
Expand the system’s adaptability to become a domain-specific expert (e.g., in artificial intelligence, finance, etc.) and support autonomous knowledge updates.

# Challenges
  Creating a self-evolving expert system is ambitious and requires careful handling of:
  Data Quality: Ensuring new information is credible and relevant.
  Model Drift: Avoiding loss of core knowledge over time.
  Resource Constraints: Managing computational resources for continuous retraining.

# Getting Started
